#### License

GNU General Public License (GPL)
The GNUâ€™s General Public License is the most popular open source license around. Richard Stallman created the GPL to protect the GNU software from becoming proprietary, and it is a specific implementation of his "copyleft" concept.

GPL is a copyleft license. This means that any software that is written based on any GPL component must be released as open source. The result is that any software that uses any GPL open source component (regardless of its percentage in the entire code) is required to release its full source code and all of the rights to modify and distribute the entire code.
